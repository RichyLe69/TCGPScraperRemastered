# Current Goals
# Max Rarity Historical Decks
# Trim Excess Nostalgia (Don't need 3x BPT's, Unlim MFC DMG's
  # Singleton Unlim copies for Nostalgia is sufficient
  # Playset for Max rarity Historical Formats
# Trim excess accessories, etc cards
# Prioritize Solitaire Decks with themes that I like, Tier 0

#- Exit Goat
#	- Goat format is Dead, Decks are only Chaos Turbo variants.
#	- cards are just Super Rare. I'll never own TP2 Jar / Serpent.
#   - Super rares suck for "aesthetic" or "photography"
#	- Extra Deck hardly used. TER is never used anymore. Metamorphosis went from 1500 to 300 Lmfao.
#	- Cards are ridiculously expensive. Only a handful of staples are useable in future formats. Most max rarity goat is ONLY useable in Goat.
#	- Random dudes dedicating their entire lives to the format. I Can't compete.
#	- I was too young during that format, no memories / Nostalgia other than DM Anime cards.
#
#- Minimize Nostalgia
#	- I don't need 3 Copies of a card for Nostalgia (I.E. 3 BPT Blue Eyes, Red Eyes, DM Etc)
#	- I don't need 1st Ed for Nostalgia - Unlims get the job done.
#
#- Maximize Edison / Tengu
#	- More skillfull formats. Actually utilize the Extra deck to make Plays
#	- Staples are nice and shiny, and can be used across multiple formats.
#	- Max rarity is more gorgeous than a handful of super / ultra rares.
#	- More interesting gameplay interactions due to lack of broken 1-of spells
#   - Prioritize: Ghost, Ultis, Secrets
#
#- Finish Retro Format Decks
#	- I Just love making Max Rarity decks...
#
#- Minimize Unnecessary Playsets
#	- No need for 3 Debris Dragons / Dandylions, Pot of Greed etc. Only need double deck maximum
#	- Allocate the extra money saved into BIG cards like Ghost 1sts, Ultis.
#
#- Minimize Unnecessary Cards
#	- A lot of Unnecessary Cards like Cyber Jar, CED, Tsuk, Meta?
#   - Sell ALL foreign. Foreign is fucking awful
#
#- Maximize Hoarder Cards
#	- These cards are the ones people love and want. People continue to hoard them which drives the prices up. - I.E random FB dudes
#   - Maximize Timmy Cards, they will buy them and keep them. Meaning supply low
#
#- Min/Max Accessories
#	- Sell Off random extra accessories, keep the good ones for myself.
